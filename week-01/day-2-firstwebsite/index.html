        <p class="text">Testing, a.k.a quality assurance became my passion in the last few years. Even well written codes and softwares have mistakes, which can potentially cause headache for users. My job is to find these problems way before the product get deployed to live environment, find the cause of the issue as detailed as possible to help developers fix it efficiently.</p>
        <p class="text">Recently I have reached a point were maunal and semi-automatic testing are not enough anymore. In order to improve my skills, from now on I am focusing on learning test automation.</p>
